Project 24
The main objective of our project is to improve image search time using CNN classification of images. For this, first we built CNN base model and then use the output as criteria to build our hash filter to improve the search time. Later, we use more sophisticated model VGG16 knowledge tarnsfer to improve the accuracy set by CNN base model.
